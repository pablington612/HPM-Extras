WALKERMEXMEDESC;A few months ago a man named William Walker came to Guaymas asking for land to create a colony to protect US soil from Indian raids. We said no, of course. Now he's marched a 45-man army to La Paz and taken the Baja Peninsula. The army's mobilizing but they might take a while to get there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
